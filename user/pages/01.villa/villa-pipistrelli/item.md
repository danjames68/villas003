> I first visited this house in 1986. It was a ruin then and the owners have brought it back to life with taste and expertise. What hasn't changed is its magnificent position, high above the Merse valley.

This large stone house, carefully restored and furnished with exceptional taste and sensitivity to the comforts of modern travellers, began its life as a place of refuge. 

Today, coming full circle to its late 12th century convent origins, there is an air of protected peace and gentle retreat about this ancient residence. 

Set in a wildlife reserve in the hills overlooking the Arno valley, L'Eremo is positioned to enjoy long vistas to rising horizons and close-up glimpses of the shy animals that are part of the Tuscan tapestry. Yet it is the house itself that will be savoured by its guests, and it is to it and to them that the owners have dedicated their efforts.
